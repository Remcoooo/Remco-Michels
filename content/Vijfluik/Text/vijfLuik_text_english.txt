My vijfluik was my end project for personality, for this project i only used HTML/CSS.
I was really happy with the end result of the website, 
this website had to have 5 element in them that where in connection with your own personality.
So i decided to make 5 different pages with each of them explaining the personality and my part in it.
This was my most favourite project i've made that year.
