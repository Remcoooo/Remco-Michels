This minecraft plugin was my first ever free project made in my second period of my first year as a Software Developer student

I started working on the custom recipe for my backpack.
If you put this in the crafting table you get a normal minecraft item wit a different recipe.
Because of this i had the abillity to make my own item with custom name and lore
to this item i could attach the backpack GUI.
Only with this specific made item you could open the GUI.

Here i make sure that the right GUI is connected to the right backpack.
The console also looks to what item the player holds if this is the right item
with name and lore of the custom item you can open the GUI of the backpack.

The GUI of the backpack plugin is safed here, so everytime the player opens his
backpack the same stuff is still in there. I used a Hashmap for this,
this makes sure that if the server stops that all the items in the GUI are getting saved to the config,
if the server reboots the config is loaded and the player recieves his items in the backpack.

I also made my own command so if the players types in the chat
he gets info about the backpack plugin.

I made sure that the model of my backpack looked different than a normal minecraft item,
i made my own model and imported it to the server.

This is the endresult of the backpack with the custom recipe and GUI.
