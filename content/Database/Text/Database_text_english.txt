This database was a school project in my first year of the education of Software development,
this was the first database i created. The database was made with PHP, HTML and CSS.
It was a really fun and educational project. We could send and recieve user information from and to the database,
so we could use this information somewhere else.
It was a challenging project because PHP was a bit different than code we used before like HTML/CSS, but we made it work in the end.
I also had the ability to play around with the styling of the page to make it more attractive for the user.
